Some choices are designed to be out of reach, symbolizing the complexities of decision-making in literature. These choices are seamlessly integrated into the game's structure, offering a compelling mix of challenge and mystery.

Disclaimer:
Some of these texts deal with deep and complex topics. They are products of their time and may contain views or beliefs no longer accepted today. This game does not agree with everything expressed in these works. Instead, it uses them as a way to interact with history and draw wisdom, not beliefs. Additionally, certain religious figures in this game are modeled after characters from classic works like The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, Paradise Lost, and others. These figures are inspired by the literary interpretations of the original texts and are not intended to be representations of the religious figures themselves. Any portrayal is strictly a fictionalized, literary approach, meant to foster engagement with these works, rather than to reflect any particular religious stance or belief.
