He surveys you with a knowing smile. 'I sense your honor,' he says. 'Will you take a challenge? Strike me as hard as you can, and in a year, I shall return the blow.'",

Yet, to your horror, he retrieves it, placing it back upon his shoulders. 'One year from today,' he says, 'at the Green Chapel.' He disappears into the forest, leaving you to prepare for what lies ahead.",

You steel yourself as the axe descends, but it merely grazes your neck, leaving you with a nick. During the short and impressive fight, the Green Knight steps back and asks, 'Have you kept your honor?'",
