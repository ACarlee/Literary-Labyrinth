      Disclaimer:
      Some of these texts deal with deep and complex topics. They are products of their time and may contain views or beliefs no 
      longer accepted today. This game does not agree with everything expressed in these works. Instead, it uses them as a way to 
      interact with history and draw wisdom, not beliefs.Additionally, certain religious figures in this game are modeled after 
      characters from classic works like The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, Paradise Lost, and others. These figures are 
      inspired by the literary interpretations of the original texts and are not intended to be representations of the religious 
      figures themselves. Any portrayal is strictly a fictionalized, literary approach, meant to foster engagement with these works, 
      rather than to reflect any particular religious stance or belief.
