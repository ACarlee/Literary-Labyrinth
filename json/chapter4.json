      "question": "As you wander deeper into the forest, the air grows thick with mystery. Emerging from the shadows is the Green Knight, his towering form both imposing and otherworldly. He surveys you with a knowing smile. 'I sense your honor,' he says. 'Will you take a challenge? Strike me as hard as you can, and in a year, I shall return the blow.'",

      "question": "The Green Knight grins broadly. 'Very well. Let us begin.' You take your strike, and with a single blow, his head falls to the ground. Yet, to your horror, he retrieves it, placing it back upon his shoulders. 'One year from today,' he says, 'at the Green Chapel.' He disappears into the forest, leaving you to prepare for what lies ahead.",

      "question": "The Green Knight’s expression darkens. 'Honor brought you here, but now you refuse it? A dishonorable choice indeed. A hypocrite does not deserve a story nor information gleaned from others' struggles.'",

      "question": "At the Green Chapel, the Green Knight awaits, axe in hand. 'You kept your word,' he says. 'Now kneel, so I may return the blow.' You brace yourself as the axe descends, but you flinch, and it only grazes your neck, leaving a small nick. Raising his axe once more, he pauses and says, 'I sense you believe you understand more about this situation than you do. You come with assumptions, do you not? You think you know my intentions and how to escape unscathed. You are mistaken. This is a test of honor, not memory. So I ask you again: would you kneel now, prepared to receive my blow, knowing it will cost you your life?'",

      "id": "q5",
      "question": "The Green Knight steps forward, raising his axe. 'Oftentimes, knowledge gets in the way of honor. I sense from you a resoluteness, not for honor, but for survival—survival you are too ashamed to admit you value. If you do not value such survival, you shall not keep it.' The axe falls swiftly, and your journey ends here.",

      "question": "The Green Knight tilts his head. 'You believe yourself honorable. But honor is not proclaimed—it is proven, often in silence. Tell me, then: what is the root of honor? Is it truth, humility, or the courage to act, even when the cost is dear?'",

      "question": "You answer, 'Honor is rooted in truth. Without it, all deeds are hollow. It is better to fail honestly than to succeed dishonestly.' The Green Knight nods slowly. 'A fair answer. But truth, I think, is not the root—it is the fruit of deeper virtues. Still, you may live, for you have spoken truly today.'",

      "question": "You answer, 'Honor is born of humility. It is the acknowledgment that we are imperfect, but we must strive to do what is right despite that.' The Green Knight smiles faintly. 'A rare answer, and a wise one. Humility is the bedrock of many virtues. You have earned my respect, and your life is yours.'",

      "question": "You answer, 'Honor is the courage to act, knowing that doing what is right may come at great personal cost.' The Green Knight tilts his head, considering. 'Bold words. And yet, I sense in them a shadow of self-interest—a longing for valor, not for virtue. Still, you show spirit. Live, and remember this moment when courage alone is not enough.'",
