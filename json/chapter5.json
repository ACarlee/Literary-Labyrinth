        "question": "As you wander out of the woods, you come across a strange settlement. Houses and shelters are visible in the distance, but between you and them are horses, standing still yet watchful. Something about their presence feels... off. The choice is yours: Will you speak to the horses in Houyhnhnm tongue (a language you know only from writings of Gulliver's travels), or will you walk past them, hoping to reach the settlement unnoticed?",

        "question": "You muster your courage and begin speaking in Houyhnhnm tongue. It feels absurd at first, neighing and whinnying like a horse, but the sound of your voice seems to capture their attention. To your amazement, they respond! You understand them perfectly, as if the writings from Gulliverâ€™s travels have unlocked a magic within you. 'What brings you here, stranger?' one horse asks with an air of dignity.",

        "question": "You choose to ignore the horses and press on toward the settlement. Yet, as you approach, the townsfolk avert their eyes and refuse to engage with you.

        "question": "The Houyhnhnms regard you with curiosity and a hint of respect. 'You are a rare human to know our ways,' one says. They speak of their harmony, their disdain for the irrationality of humans, and their ideals of order and reason. You feel the weight of their words.

You live constantly on edge, like any moment, they will confront you. Finally, they say 'You are welcome to visit, but we cannot accept you fully.' With no other choice, you leave, progressing to the settlement nearby.",
