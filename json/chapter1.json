We turn to literature for many reasons: to seek wisdom, to lose ourselves, or perhaps something in between. So, wanderer, what brings you here? Speak, and let the story unveil your path.",

But beware—conversations are perilous things. They twist and turn, often becoming far more than you bargained for. So, traveler, I ask: are you certain you wish to proceed?",
