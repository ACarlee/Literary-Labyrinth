        "question": "As you wander through the forest, down the winding path, the rustle of the leaves catches your attention, and from a distance, you spot a woman seated upon a stone bench, her presence as bold as her attire. A laugh escapes her lips, rich and full, as if the very air around her is lighter for it. She eyes you with a curious, yet knowing, gaze as you draw near. “Well now, what have we here? A wanderer, lost in thought—or are you lost in something else, hm?” she teases, adjusting her bright, flowery hat and giving you a wink. “I suppose I could tell you all about my own travels, though none are as grand as I’d like to believe! But what of you? I do adore meeting new faces on the road, especially those with a tale or two to tell... or perhaps even more still, eh?” She leans forward, her voice dropping into a playful whisper, “Tell me, what exactly are you seeking on this journey of yours? Are you in search of riches, a lover’s kiss, or maybe a scandal to rival the greatest of the Canterbury tales?”",

        "question": "As you approach the Wife of Bath, she looks at you with a raised brow, her lips curving into a teasing smile. “Ah, knowledge, you say?” She chuckles softly. “What good is all that knowledge trapped in your head? You spend all your time buried in books, forgetting to live—to breathe, to speak to others. I get my knowledge from talking, from sharing a story or two. There’s enough to learn from the people around you, my dear. Why would you ever settle for a book? A book can’t tell you the joy of a fire crackling or the laughter of strangers, or the weight of a hand on your shoulder in a moment of silence.” She looks you up and down, her eyes glinting with mischief. “Go ahead, think about it. You’ll find far more wisdom in a simple conversation than in the thickest volumes of ink and paper. Don’t be so quick to dismiss the world around you. You might learn something that’ll make all those facts feel awfully wrong in comparison.”",

        "question": "“Damned straight, I know.” She grins, an unexpected warmth in her voice. “Come follow me, and learn to listen for a change. I’ll tell you tales—tales that will fill your head with more knowledge than any book ever could. Real knowledge. The kind that comes with the smell of the forest and the taste of wine, not the staleness of a library.”",

Well, books and cold facts may seem steady, but the world is alive, my dear, and people—especially people—are where the real wisdom lies. You’ll find yourself starved for meaning if you rely only on the sterile comfort of pages. But go ahead, may you find everything you seek in the pages of your book. Best wishes for that! I will continue living my life, living it as best I can regardless of the instructions of some dam book.” With that, she turns away, leaving you alone in the forest.",

        "question": "The Wife of Bath gazes at you, her eyes flickering with amusement, as though she’s weighing your words carefully. “Power?” She laughs softly, almost to herself. “Oh, child, I could tell you many a tale of what power does. The power that women have over men… Now that’s a story for the ages. But you—what kind of power excites you? Tell me. Do you seek the protection from others, or do you wish to dominate them?”",

        "id": "q6",
        "question": "Her expression shifts for a moment—more serious, but not without a soft, knowing edge. “Protection, you say?” she muses, the light in her eyes dimming slightly. “Protection is a slippery thing. It sounds noble, doesn’t it? But let me tell you, protection isn’t always possible. You can shield someone with all your might, but at the end of the day, you’ll find the most vulnerable part of you is the one that cares. You can hide behind walls, but the truth is, there’s always a crack somewhere. And that's where they’ll get you. So, if you truly wish to protect something, be willing to let yourself be vulnerable first. It’s the only way to live freely.” She pauses, giving you a knowing look. “But I warn you, the harder you try to protect, the more you stand to lose.”",

        "question": "Looking quickly around her, she smiles ruefully, “Vulnerability doesn’t mean weakness, my dear. It means being open—to love, to loss, to everything. Power that protects—sometimes that’s an illusion. Protection is a wall, and a wall can be brought down. But vulnerability? It’s the real strength. When you expose yourself, you show others your worth, not just demand it. But, now is not the time or place. I can promise you nothing is worth your time following me. Explore the world, find your love. It changes lives.” She begins to walk away, “Not always for the best, but such is life.”",

        "question": "She eyes you critically, letting out a short laugh, almost derisive. “Dominance, huh?” Her tone softens only slightly. “You’re a normal one, aren’t you? Most people seek power to dominate. It’s the way of the world. You’ll get what you want—until you can’t. And then you’ll be left with your throne of dust and regret. Good luck, my dear, ensnaring all the beasts of the forest. And don’t come crying to me when they bite back.” With that, she gives a mock salute and strides away, leaving you to consider her words.",

        "question": "The Wife of Bath laughs wistfully, her expression becoming a mixture of fondness and sorrow. “Love, huh?” She lets out a deep sigh, eyes far away, as if lost in the memories of her own long past. “Love is a fickle beast, my dear. One moment, it’s full of life, overflowing, and the next... empty. It leaves you feeling alive—and dead—all at once. You’ll be alive with passion, only to find yourself hollow when the fire burns out. But oh, isn’t it beautiful, the fire? Even when it burns you? Especially then.” She looks back at you, her eyes sharp now, as if to gauge your reaction. “You want love? Let me warn you—many seek love, but they don’t seek the right love. What love are you truly after? Do you want acceptance, safety? Those are the easy kinds of love. But love is the most dangerous thing you can do. To love another—that’s the hardest thing in the world. It’s not safe. It never is.”",

        "question": "Her laugh is bitter, but tinged with a dark amusement. “You seek love? True love, the one that burns and tears you apart? I hope you understand what you’re asking for. You’re asking for pain. You’re asking to give something of yourself to another and let them do with it as they wish. Don’t be so naive. Love doesn’t always end the way you want it to. But that’s the beauty of it, isn’t it?” She turns away, smiling to herself. “Go ahead, chase it. But remember, you can’t control love. It’ll always control you.” With that, she turns around. That conversation obviously didn't interest her enough to stay.",

And in the end, you’ll find it empty, just like a bed that’s never been slept in. But go ahead—seek safety. You’ll be alright. Until you’re not.” With another shake of her head, she turns around and walks away.",

Some empty notion you cling to in the dark, hoping someone will see it and say, ‘Yes, you’re worthy!’ It’s nothing but approval, my dear. That’s all it is. A reputation built on lies and stories—I can build you a reputation with a couple of well-spun tales. What’s the point of honor if you’re going to die for it? Are you going to live your life for what others think of you? Are you that small?” She leans in closer, her eyes flashing with fire. “Go on then—find your honor in the forest. Go ahead, slay your beasts. Do what you must. But you’ll never find anything real in that. Honor is as hollow as the words you use to describe it.” She steps back with a grin, almost daring you. “Go ahead—find honor in the natural world. Tell me how you do. I’m dying to see it.” Without another word, she turns back and walks away. That conversation obviously did not interest her enough to stay.",

You follow close behind, her voice weaving through the trees like the melody of a song half-remembered. She speaks of long-forgotten kingdoms and the wisdom of travelers who traded gold for stories. But as you walk, the trees seem to grow taller and closer together, their canopies knitting tighter above. The sunlight dims, filtering through in fractured rays that do little to illuminate the path. Her voice grows softer, blending with the rustle of leaves and the distant chirp of unseen birds. You quicken your pace to keep up, but the forest thickens, the undergrowth snagging at your legs. You push forward, heart pounding, certain she must be just out of sight. But the path becomes less clear, the ground uneven and littered with roots that seem to twist and writhe underfoot. Finally, you stop, the silence pressing in like a held breath. She’s gone. You stand there, alone, surrounded by the denseness of the wild, unsure if you have lost her or if she led you here intentionally. Either way, you are left with nothing but the lingering warmth of her stories and the echo of her laughter as the forest closes in.",
