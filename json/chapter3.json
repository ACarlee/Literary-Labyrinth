            "question": "The forest opens into a small clearing, where a striking woman paces back and forth, her long gown trailing in the dirt as if the earth itself bows beneath her. Her face is etched with a storm of emotions—grief, anger, and something like defiance. She mutters under her breath, her words sharp enough to slice the still air. As you step closer, her gaze snaps to you, and her voice rings out, both commanding and curious. 'Who are you, to wander so boldly into my torment? Speak quickly, or perhaps you’ve come to judge me, as so many others do.'",

            "id": "q2",
            "question": "The woman regards you coolly, her chin lifting with a regal grace. 'I am Mariam, queen to Herod, though not by my own desire. My father and brother—murdered by his hand, and yet he dares to call me his wife. Tell me, wanderer, do you believe love can coexist with such betrayal?' Her voice softens, though the fire in her eyes remains. 'Speak, if you dare. I find it amusing to hear how strangers make sense of the senseless.'",

            "id": "q3",
            "question": "Mariam narrows her eyes, studying you with suspicion before her expression softens into something closer to weariness. 'Yes, I am Mariam. And if you know my name, then you must know my tragedy as well. My life is a tale woven of grief and defiance.' She pauses, her voice growing quieter, as if speaking to herself. 'Even now, I debate whether to forgive Herod or to curse his name until my final breath. Tell me, stranger, what would you do in my place?'",

            "question": "Mariam nods, a bitter smile tugging at her lips. 'You speak the truth, and yet, what good does truth do me? He holds the power, and I—' she gestures to herself, her voice laced with irony, 'I am the queen in name only. Come, stranger, let us return to the castle. Perhaps you will see for yourself how fate mocks me.'",

It binds and breaks in equal measure. Come, stranger. Walk with me to the castle, and I will show you the face of love twisted by power and pride.'",

            "question": "Mariam regards you with a mix of skepticism and curiosity. 'Forgive him? Do you think forgiveness would free me? Or would it only tighten the chains that already bind me to him?' She shakes her head, her expression unreadable. 'You are either wise or naive, stranger. Come. Let us see what wisdom or folly awaits us at the castle.'",

            "question": "The walk to the castle is somber, the forest growing darker as the towering walls of Herod’s home loom ahead. Mariam speaks little, her mind clearly elsewhere. When you arrive, the air is tense with unspoken words, and Herod himself greets you with a wary gaze. Yet, it doesn’t take long for accusations to fly. Herod, consumed by paranoia, accuses Mariam of plotting his murder. The room erupts in chaos as all eyes turn to her. Among all of the voices shouting out, Mariam's is absent. You know that should she not speak, she will killed for something you know she did not do (assuming you did the reading in class).",

Do you think you can change fate?' Her voice echoes in the chamber, silencing the crowd for a moment. But Herod’s wrath is unyielding, and Mariam is led away to meet her doom.",

However, your passionate, angry words resonate with the king, who is struck by the strength of your conviction. 'You speak as a man with courage,' Herod says, turning his anger towards Salame. 'She has schemed and brought shame upon this nation!' Since the king could believe a man more so than any woman, Salame is sentenced to death, beheaded before the court. The king warns you to leave the castle and never speak of this incident again for no nation will want to remember such an event.",
