As you become more integrated into the system, the voice of your past haunts you: 'You allowed humanity to fall from paradise. Is this not the second chance you sought? A perfect society of perfect humans' Yet doubts grow. What will you do?",

As he studies you carefully, you brace yourself for questions about your destination, companions, and reasons for leaving.

But, why could you not keep them? You notice how, when trying to fit in the perfect society, you become less human. You carry the weight of a missing penny and lost secret for the rest of your life- or at least, what you hope is a life.",
