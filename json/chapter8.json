A perfect society of perfect humans' Yet doubts grow. What will you do?",

But, why couldn't you keep them? You notice how, when trying to fit in the perfect society, you become less human. You carry the weight of a missing penny and lost secret for the rest of your life- or at least, what you hope is a life.",
